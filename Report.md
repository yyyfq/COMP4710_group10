##### Introduction

At the end of 2019, the new coronavirus swept the world. As of November 12, 2021, there were over 251 million infection cases and 5.07 million deaths worldwide. This virus has mutated into various variants in countries like the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States, India and Brazil.  These variants increase the severity of the disease and lead to faster transmission, higher mortality, and reduced vaccine effectiveness. Besides, the virus also challenges the global medical system, including the sharp increase in the demand for hospital beds. There is a severe shortage of medical equipment, and many medical staff have also been infected, showing the harm brought by the new coronavirus to the world.

 

According to the COVID-related issues published by the WHO, the primary way of transmission of the new coronavirus is respiratory droplet transmission and contact transmission. Common signs of people infected with the coronavirus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, tiredness, and loss of taste or smell. The infection can also lead to pneumonia, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, loss of speech or mobility, confusion, chest pain, and even death in more severe cases. Although the World Health Organization stated that frequent hand washing, disinfection, social distancing, wearing a mask, and not touching the face could protect a person from infection, some people may unfortunately become one of the cases. Therefore, the anticipation and effective screening of different cases' conditions (such as age and gender) and their possible symptoms are crucial for reducing the burden on the healthcare system and medical staff. Machine learning classification algorithms and data sets have also become essential tools for designing COVID-19 prediction models.
